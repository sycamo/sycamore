# FEWD Final Project

### Created by 
Leo Lau

## Background

* Life is too short for email communications
* Simply too tiring to read work emails, bills/statements and interrupting junk mails
* The more you sign up for freebies online, the more junk mails you end up with

## ARE MARKETING EMAILS EVIL?

* Email Marketing is still proven the most cost-effective promotion method for small to large companies
* As long as it is not illegitimate, the spamming engine won't stop because the marginal cost is virtually zero
* They want to convey appealing messages to customers, but emails are just like technology in the Stone Age -- Killing Creativity

## What's this project about?

* I believe some messages are worth reading
* I believe good messages will make people thrilled like receiving love letters in the old mailbox
* So many people say EMAIL MARKETING is dead, but no one comes up to bury it and erect a new way of effect digital direct marketing
* This project is a baby step to make a new canvas, yet manifest with the old and ugly messages fist
* Much more to do to overthrow the status quo
